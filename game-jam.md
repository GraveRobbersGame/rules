# GROS Game Jam Guidelines
## Presented by the Academy for Resurrected Games and Holdings (ARGH)

## Introduction

Welcome to the GROS Game Jam Guidelines! This manual is designed to guide you through the process of participating in a game jam focused on creating an expansion for the card game **Grave Robbers From Outer Space** and submitting it to be considered for publication in an official release. Whether you're a seasoned game designer or a newcomer to the world of game development, this jam is your ticket to unleash your creativity and construct (and parody) B-movie masterpieces with which you can do battle against your friends.

## What is a Game Jam?

A game jam is an event where participants come together to design, develop, and create games within a specified time frame. It's an immersive and often exhilarating experience that encourages innovation, experimentation, and collaboration. Game jams provide a platform for creators to turn their ideas into playable prototypes and gain valuable insights into the game development process.

## Why Grave Robbers From Outer Space?

Grave Robbers From Outer Space offers a unique opportunity for game designers to explore the world of B-Movies, infusing humor, creativity, and campy charm into their creations. From over-the-top plots to quirky characters, B-Movies provide a rich tapestry for imaginative game design. This event aims to celebrate the spirit of B-Movies, allowing participants to craft entertaining, memorable experiences.

## How the Jam Works

### Theme and Constraints

Every game jam has a theme or set of constraints that serve as a creative catalyst for participants. These elements provide a starting point and inspire unique interpretations. In a GROS game jam, there are constraint of theme as well as constraints of format:

**The Movie Theme:** A genre of movies is usually chosen ahead of time to be the main theme of the jam (slasher flicks, kung fu action movies, hollywood monsters, etc.). Having a solid theme that isn't overly broad is a key to a good game jam, and often setting an era of film within a genre can be a big help as well.

Any cards created for the jam should be taken directly from tropes that are well known in that theme and shouldn't stray too far -- unless there is a good in-theme reason to do so. For example a theme such as "time travel" may pull from any number of genres, but should be strongly linked to the central premise.

**The Feature Pack Format:** The unit of a new expansion to GROS is the Feature Pack, which is usually made up of the following cards:

- 3 Characters
- 3 Creatures
- 2 Locations
- 2 Props
- 3 Special Effects
- 2 Plot Twists, and
- 1 Roll the Credits

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rules for how these cards word if you haven't already.

Each Feature Pack should be more or less self-contained to make fun of a single movie or well-known set of tropes. But since you need two Feature Packs to play a game, the final deliverable is usually a **Double Feature** or a pair of Feaure Packs which can work synergistically with each other.

### Phases of the Game Jam

1. **Preparation Phase:** This is the time to brainstorm ideas, form teams (if applicable), and plan your B-Movie card game. Consider the mechanics, theme integration, and target audience.

1. **Development Phase:** Once the jam officially begins, you'll have a set amount of time to bring your Double Feature to life. Focus on implementing your chosen mechanics, testing, and refining gameplay.

1. **Testing Phase:** After completing your initial build, thoroughly playtest your B-Movie card game. Gather feedback from peers to fine-tune mechanics, balance, and overall player experience.

1. **Submission Phase:** When the development period concludes, submit your finished card game according to the instructions provided. This includes all necessary files, documentation, and any supplementary materials.

## Tips for Creating GROS Feature Packs

1. **Channel the B-Movie Spirit:** Embrace the quirks, humor, and over-the-top drama that define B-Movies. Let your creativity run wild!

1. **Craft Memorable Tropes:** This game thrives in parody of familiar characters and tropes, so lean towards ones that are well-known. Infuse your game with eccentric, unforgettable memes that would feel right at home in a B-Movie. Don't let your creations be too specific. Try and make fun of patterns that exist between similar movies and shows.

1. **Playtest, Playtest, Playtest:** Continual playtesting is essential. It helps identify areas for improvement, refine mechanics, and ensure an enjoyable player experience.
