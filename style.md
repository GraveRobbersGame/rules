# Grave Robbers From Outer Space
# Style Guide (2024.02.05)

This document is a series of requirements for creating new GROS cards that must be adhered to in order for a card to make it through to final Production.

## Content Release

**GROS cards belong to the Community.** As such all text and artwork that a GROS Compatible Game employs must first be released under the GROS Free License.

## Keywords

"Keywords" in GROS are words that have specific meanings, and as a result must be capitalized as proper nouns. Current keywords include:

* Different card types (and their plurals):
    * **Character**
    * **Creature**
    * **Location**
    * **Prop**
    * **Plot Twist**
    * **Roll the Credits**
    * **Special Effect**
* Words referring to players (and their plurals):
    * **Player**
    * **Opponent**
    * **Attacker**
    * **Defender**
    * **Director**
    * Or others not listed here. If it's referring to a Player, it should be a proper noun.
* **Creature attack** or **attack** - An attack made by a Creature against a Player is always in lower-case.
* **Name** - The name of the card.
    * The Name or portion of a name of another card when mentioned in Ability text *must* be printed in double quotes. For example: 
        * *"Only the Virgin Survives"*
        * *"Cut!"*
    * If a card refers itself, there is no need for quotes. For example:
        * *When Skippy is cast in a movie...*
* **Quote** - The text of the Quote of a card.
* **Title** - The upside-down Title word at the bottom of the card.
* **Stat** which can be either the card's **Defense** or **Attack**.
    * Often these may be referred to as:
        * **Defensive Strength** or **DS** and 
        * **Attack Strength** or **AS**
        * This is especially the case when disambiguating against a **Creature attack**.
    * When Stats are **changed**, there are several ways to refer to how they are changed.
        * When a Stat is **increased** or **decreased**, use plus (**+**) and minus (**-**) signs. For example:
            * *The Sister's Defense is +1 against...*
            * *The Robot's Attack is -5 at Aquatic locations.*
        * When a Stat is **re-assigned**, use an equals sign (**=**). For example:
            * *Defense = 0 if in the same Movie as...*
            * *Printed Defense = -5 during 'Psycho' attacks.*
    * When referring to **a Stat and all attached cards and bonuses that affect it**, use the word **"total"**. For example:
        * *Bank the Frat Boy's total Defense.*
* **Trait** or **Traits** - The adjectives associated with a card.
    * Individual Traits when mentioned in Ability text *must* be printed in single quotes. For example: 
        * *'Male'*
        * *'Supernatural' Creature*
        * *'Kung Fu' attack*
* **Ability text** or **Abilities** - The card's Ability text.
* **Popcorn** and **Popcorn Bucket** (or just **Bucket**) - The main resource of the game.

## Text Referencing

When card text is referenced outside of the ways described above, it must be in double quotes. For example:
* *Any card with "Zombie" in its Name.*
* *If the card has the word "Cop" on it...*
* *Search for a card illustrated by "Steve Caruso"...*
* etc.

## Quote & Ability Length

A card *must* have a Quote, but does not need to have Ability text.

The general *rule of thumb* is that wherever possible, a Quote should not exceed two lines of text (otherwise it becomes too large for a subtitle), and that Ability text should be short and succinct enough to be (a) well understood and (b) legible once the typesetter lays it out.

## Artwork & Card Text

All submitted artwork that uses the standard card template should also be in a 1:1 (square) aspect ratio. Unlike the original run, it does not need to be in black and white.

Additionally for Official cards, the artwork on a card and *all* card text should be "PG-13":

* No direct frontal nudity or hyper-sexualized characters. The themes of GROS *do* involve sexuality – especially playing upon different established tropes and themes in B-movies – so when it's on-theme, where art can be suggestive it cannot be blatant or explicit. Comedic censoring is welcomed.
* Likewise, profanity should be kept to the level of broadcast TV edits. Instead, be creative with mincing oaths, and using substitutes with comedic value.
