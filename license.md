# GROS Free License (2023.11)

## Introduction & The Spirt of the Thing

For as long as we have existed, humans have been storytellers. From the earliest cave paintings to the latest Hollywood blockbusters, storytelling has been an integral part of our culture and our identity. It is as if the art of storytelling is ingrained in our very fabric and soul with patterns of archetypes that emerge to be told and retold in a thousand different ways. These patterns are a fundamental part of who we are as a species.

And yet, in recent times, there has been a growing trend towards the commercialization and commodification of storytelling. The rise of intellectual property laws and copyright restrictions have made it increasingly difficult for individuals to freely express themselves and build upon our favorite plots and characters. This trend not only restricts the free flow of ideas, but it ultimately harms our ability to fundamentally connect with one another through our common experiences.

Therefore, in recognition of these facts, we present to you the GROS Free License. This license is meant to grant individuals the right to express themselves within the familiar tropes that everyone knows... and play with those experiences freely in the medium of a humble card game, accessible to all.
